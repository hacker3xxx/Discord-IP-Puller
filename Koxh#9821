Discord Webhook IP Grabber

When it runs it sends your ip and location to a discord webhook of your choice. This program was made for educational purposes only.

For it to run correctly you have to download Python and a coding software (i suggest Visual Studio Code) After you have downloaded python, go to Command Prompt (Cmd) and type: 
1.pip install requests 
2.pip install json 
3.pip install dhooks 
4.pip install datetime 
I'll have a .bat file that installs them for you just to save time.

When you are finished with all of the above, open the Coding Software of your choice and put your webhook's URL in the yourwebhooksurlhere part, and then run it. It should work perfectly. You can of course turn it to an exe and combine it with the bat just so it only takes 1 click for the other person to open it.
